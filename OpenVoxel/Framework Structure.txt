Lightmap Voxel Mesh [
	Info [
		The Lightmap Voxel Mesh is an Axis-Aligned lightmap which stores information
		about how much light reaches each individual voxel position
		
		It's values will be affected by voxels with emissive properties from Voxel Meshes,
		and it's values will also be effected by opaque geometry from voxels inside Voxel Meshes
		
		The lightmap's values will be recalculated only in specific regions when immediately required,
		causing it to have very little performance effect when the geometry is completely static

		8 bits: Red Light Level 
		8 bits: Green Light Level
		8 bits: Blue Light Level
		
		24 bits / 3 bytes
		1000^3 area of voxels = 3 * 1000^3 = 3 gigabytes of CPU memory

Voxel Mesh [
	Info [
		Can be scaled or rotated to whatever, but it has to apply to all voxels in the mesh,
		as of right now each mesh has a max radius of 127 voxels in all directions (x, y, z),
		but they easily can be bound together to make bigger objects
		
		Emissive voxels in this mesh will affect the parent Lightmap Voxel Mesh, opaque objects
		will also effect it by reducing the light levels in areas that have their LOS to another light
		blocked
